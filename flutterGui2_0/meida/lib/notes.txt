=== Choosing the AppBar style ===
The objective is to make the user experience as seemless as possible, this includes puting the available actions as close to 
user's reach as possible.

There are couple of ways of handling AppBar and actions
With actions we add buttons and stuff to the right side of the bar.
With leading property we add them to the left.
It is also possible to use the title and place a row of button widgets, this provides the most flexibility in positioning them.

The third option works best in case of authorization screen, considering that with rezising, the AppBar will not be affected since
there are only a handful actions that should fit a small sized screen.
This approach will not work for many actions, instead, use a humburder button with toolbar left or right.
