How to ensure the client has the ID of chatroom they joined?
Should I implement proper db messaging first?
CLI is no longer sufficient, need proper GUI

Dart - real-time messaging
Redis - online users tracking, real-time messaging
PostgreSQL - Long term data storage
Queue struct - Short memory, unrecoverable messages

golang server - accept and handle client connections via TCP
Flutter - cross-platform Backend

Valid key types are those that have equality operators '==' and '!=' fully defined.

TLS over TCP - communication encryption
bcrypt - hashed password storage with salt
Json - client-server format message/request exchang

multithreading - daemon listeners, client socket connection handler routines


Problems:
User search
Room search
Database connection failure handling
