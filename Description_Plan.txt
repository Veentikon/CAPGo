Problems to solve:
1. I need some kind of interface, preferrably initially a simple command line tool to communicate with the server
2. How to format Input and Output from/to the server
    Decided to communicate via http (httpx with package) in Json format
    Later can include sockets for persistance and real-time communication along with asynch calls
3. Do I use multithreading
    Not at the initial stages, first will ensure I have a frame for the program.
    Once I have that working, I will implemenent Server multithreading (Why I chose Golang) and possible client multithreading.
    Client applicaiton will have two threads running, one to listen to client requests, another for incoming messages
4. Choice of GUI, either Web applicaiton or an android/pc application 
    Have not decided on the specifics but I am leaning towards a cross platform implementation, either Flutter or React/React 
    native
